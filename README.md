# Yransfer Learning Based Speed Limit Traffic Sign Recognition with Multilingual Audio Alerts

## Overview

This research project focuses on developing a comprehensive ResNet model based on transfer learning for recognizing and classifying speed limit traffic signs with multilingual audio alerts. The motivation stems from the critical need to maintain road safety and effective traffic management, especially with the increasing number of vehicles on the road.

## Motivation

In India, the demand for an efficient speed sign identification system arises from the countryâ€™s diverse linguistic landscape. Effectively communicating speed limit signs to drivers in their preferred language is crucial for road safety. This project addresses this need by delivering multilingual audio alerts to inform drivers of speed limits.

## Dataset

We utilized speed limit sign classes from two datasets:
- German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB)
- Indian Traffic Signs Prediction (85 classes)

## Results

Our trained models achieved impressive test accuracies:
- 99.96% using ResNet-50
- 98.62% using other state-of-the-art methods, including CNN and VGG.

## Keywords

Traffic Sign Recognition, Convolutional Neural Network, ResNet, Transfer Learning, Multilingual Audio Alerts.
